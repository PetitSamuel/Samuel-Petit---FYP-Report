\chapter*{Abstract}

News organisations play a major role in modern society and have been subject to many studies which rely on news articles and computer systems to extract relationships that are not always obvious. Given the importance of the English language in the field of research and computer science, less attention has been given to other languages such as French. Moreover, COVID-19 has recently impacted many aspects of society, putting news articles in a very important position. This thesis sets out to examine which variables have an impact on the language used in French news when writing articles about COVID-19.

A corpus of 305,454 French news articles, consisting of over 167 million words was collected from 226 sources starting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic up until the day this study took place. The date range for data collection started in January 2020 and ended in March 2021. Three specialised dictionaries were built in order to perform topic specific analyses. These lexica all relate to key topics of the COVID-19 pandemic and target the sentiments of: Death, Vaccine and Virus. Through the use of sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques the sentiment of the corpus was computed.

The sentiment proxies obtained from the corpus were used to identify underlying relationships affecting the amount of sentiment that can be found within French news articles. This was done through the use of Vector autoregression models which enables to identify and quantify causality between multiple variables.

\section*{\Huge{Acknowledgements}}

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Khurshid Ahmad for introducing me to this topic and guiding me throughout this project. I started with very little knowledge on many of the topics covered in this thesis and I have no doubt that your supervision and support throughout the year was a key factor in what I have learned as well as completing this project.

I would also like to thank my parents for pushing me to study abroad at Trinity, doing so changed my life in many ways that I could have never imagined. Throughout my time as a Trinity student I have learned so much and made many invaluable connections.
